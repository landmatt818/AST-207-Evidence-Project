        <h2>Part 1: Observational Data</h2>

            <h3>Cosmological Redshift</h3>
                <p>
                    While working at the Mount Wilson Observatory Edwin Hubble used its 100-inch telescope to observe clouds of light in the sky then called nebulae. In 1923 while peering at the Andromeda nebulae he identified what appeared to be individual stars. Through further observation he noticed a Cephid variable star. These stars change their brightness in cycles that are used to calculate distance. Hubble had deduced that this star and others he observed must lie outside the boundary of the Milky Way claiming that Andromeda was not a nebula in our galaxy but an entire galaxy of its own. Up to this point most astronomers believed that the Milky Way contained everything we knew, but at that very moment our understanding of the physical size of our Universe exploded.

                <p>
                    Hubble continued his observations of nebulae further categorizing many of these objects as galaxies. By 1929 Hubble had begun observing the light emitted from these distant galaxies. He noticed that the light shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. Hubble originally attributed this effect to be a result of the Doppler Effect. The Doppler Effect describes the change in the wavelength and frequency of waves emitted by a source which is in motion relative to the observer. (NASA, n.d.). However, it was later realized that the redshift of the light was a result of the expansion of space itself. This phenomenon is called cosmological redshift. Nevertheless, Hubble revealed that distant galaxies were all moving away from Earth. Additionally, he showed that the further away from Earth a galaxy is the faster it moves away from us. This observation is known as Hubble’s Law which relates a galaxy’s distant to its velocity.

            <h3>Composition of The Universe</h3>
                <p>
                    The late 19th century saw a new technique to study the night sky. Astronomers began using spectroscopy to map the light emitted by stars onto photographic plates. Spectroscopy is the study of the absorption and emission of light and other radiation by matter. (ATA Scientific, accessed 2024). With this technique astronomers were able to reveal the chemical composition of celestial objects by comparing their spectral lines with those of known elements. Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin, while working on her PhD at Harvard University, began analyzing the absorption lines in stellar spectra. Just two years later she produced a thesis detailing the composition of stars. Through calculations she concluded that the Sun and the other stars were composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium. The rest of the elements represented less than two percent of the matter in stars.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Later in 1944, Dutch astronomer Hendrik Van De Hulst had predicted the existence of a hydrogen emission line. He categorized the line to be 21.2 cm derived from a rare effect of the electron in the hydrogen atom changing its spin. In the neutral state of hydrogen the electron can flips its spin opposite the proton. This brings the atom to a lower energy state releasing a photon. This effect occurs only once every 11 million years for a single hydrogen atom, but with the proposed abundance of hydrogen in the Universe it should release a steady detectable signal. This signal was later observed by Harvard radio astronomers Harold Ewen and Edward Purcell in 1951. Thus, confirming the existence of abundant hydrogen in the intergalactic medium.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Together these two observations revealed that the lightest element, hydrogen, must be the most common element by number in the Universe. 
                </p>

            <h3>The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation</h3>
                <p>
                    In 1948, while working on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Ralph Alpherin predicted the existence of low energy microwave radiation left over from the birth of the Universe. The light would have been the leftover heat from the early hot and dense era of the early Universe that has been traveling though space ever since. It was not until 1965 that this radiation was finally observed. Two radio astronomers, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, at Bell laboratories had acquired an obsolete radio antenna previously used to collect and amplify radio signals sent from long distances. They planned on using the antenna to continue their work on radio astronomy.  When they began their observations, they noticed a consistent background noise; a signal in the microwave range coming from all directions. They ruled out every possible interference from urban cities, radiation from the Milky Way, and even pigeons nested in the antenna. They finally admitted that the noise was not an error. At the same time theoretical physicist Robert Dicke had been studying the theories about the big bang and was searching for observational evidence of the previously predicted background radiation. The three got in contact and Dicke was sure that they had discovered what he was looking for. Before this the big bang theory was not a widely accepted idea but this major discovery created growing support for this explanation of origins.

        <h2>Part 2: Models</h2>
            <h3>General Relativity</h3>
                <p>
                    We knew that space was expanding years before Hubble’s observations of galaxies. In Einsteins original theory of general relativity which described how gravity affects spacetime he calculated that the previously believed static Universe was unstable. Agreeing with these previously developed notions, Einstein added a cosmological constant to his equations keeping the real expanding Universe as a static model. Critics of this idea such as Russian mathematician Alexandar Friedman along with Belgian physicist and priest Georges Lemaitre showed argued that general relativity accuratley described an expanding Universe. Einstein was unconvinced until Hubble’s observations of the redshift of galaxies calling the addition of his cosmological constant his "biggest blunder".
                </p>
                <figure>
                    <img src="einstein.webp" width="200" height="255">
                    
                </figure>
                <p>
                    The portion of general relativity that explains the expansion of space is the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric. A set of solutions to Einstein’s field equations that describe an expanding spacetime based on the distribution of matter. These models predict that space itself stretches over time, causing light traveling through it to be stretched as well, resulting in a longer wavelength that is redder in color. This explanation for the effect of cosmological redshift using the FLRW metric provides the theoretical framework for understanding Hubble's direct observations of redshifting galaxies, linking them to the expansion of the universe.
                </p>
            <h3>The Primeval Atom Theory</h3>
                <p>
                    After forming the solutions to Einstein’s field equations describing expanding space, Lemaitre extended these ideas. If you run the clock backwards space would be smaller and denser in the past. Go back far enough and it would seem reasonable that all matter was packed into a single point. Lemaitre called this the “primeval atom”. This “particle” exploded into everything there is creating space, time and resulting in the expansion of space itself. The model of the primeval atom, which describes the origin of matter and the expansion of space, was used to further explain Hubble's observations and support the concept of an expanding Universe.

                </figure>
            <h3>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</h3>
                <p>
                    Great efforts by George Gamow and his collaborators resulted in a successful theory explaining the apparent abundance of light elements in the Universe. Believed to have occurred in the first few minutes of the Big Bang, quarks and gluons condensed into protons and neutrons, which later combined—through the cooling of space—into deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen. These deuterium nuclei collided with each other to form helium. Additionally, trace amounts of lithium were created during this time. From these few elements, the first stars were born, and through nuclear fusion, stars created the heavier elements. However, during this early synthesis of elements shortly after the Big Bang, the Universe’s composition consisted almost entirely of light elements. This accurately explains observations from stellar spectra and the 21 cm hydrogen line, both of which indicate that the Universe is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, a composition only possible in a hot, dense early Universe.

            <h3>Cosmic Inflation</h3>
                <p>
                    After the incredibly discovery of the CMB a few problems in cosmology arose. One of those being The Horizon Problem. It relates to the homogeneity of the CMB and that distant regions of the Universe appear strangely uniform in temperature which would be impossible with standard Big Bang expansion as these distant regions should not be able to interact with each other as it would exceed the speed of light. From this, cosmologist Alan Guth proposed the idea of cosmic inflation. Early in the Universe shortly after the Big Bang the space rapidly expanded by a factor of 10^26 in only a fraction of a second. This effectively solved The Horizon Problem and became a accurate and successful model used to explain features observed and measured in the CMB.

        <h2>part 3: Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                The Big Bang Theory stands as one of the most scientifically supported and accurate models for the origins of the Universe. Its argument of a hot, dense early Universe is evidence by multiple, independent observations. The CMB provides direct evidence of the Universe’s early conditions showing a uniform temperature consistent with a rapidly expanding and cooling Universe. Observations of stellar and intergalactic dust composition are precisely explained through Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, which accurately predicts the ratios of hydrogen, helium, and the trace amounts of lithium observed today. Hubble’s Law, derived from the observation of redshifted galaxies, demonstrates the continuing expansion of spacetime, mathematically described the FLRW metric. Together they form a cohesive framework for the Big Bang Theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                The extraordinary success of the Big Bang Theory reflects the culmination of scientific knowledge, precise technologies, and the incredible work of observational astronomers, theoretical physicists, and cosmologists. Humanity has accomplished the remarkable feat of revealing the origins of everything, transforming what once seemed unimaginable into a profound understanding of the Universe.
